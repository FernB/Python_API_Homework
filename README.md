# Python_API_Homework

This is my submission for the Matplotlib Homework.

The data was presented and analysed in a Jupyter Notebook, 6.1.4, with a Python kernel, 3.8.5. 
A random list of cities was generated using latitude and longitudes generated using numpy 1.19.2 with citipy 0.0.5 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) and this city data was collected from Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
Results were manipulated using pandas 1.1.3. Pandas was also used along with numpy 1.19.2 and scipy 1.5.2 to calculated descriptive statistics and matplotlib 3.3.2 was used to create graphs.

Mapping was conducted using Google Geocoding and Google Places APIs (https://developers.google.com/maps). All mapping images are saved into the output folder.
Plots and regressions of weather trends are saved into the output folder.
